Writeup TODO:
--------1. 
• A table listing the average tree size for several values of n. (A graph is insufficient, although you can
have that too; we need to see the actual numbers.)
• A description of your guess for the function f(n).

---------2. 
Which algorithm did you use, and why?
• Are the growth rates (the f(n)) surprising? Can you come up with an explanation for them?
• How long does it take your algorithm to run? Does this make sense? Do you notice things like the
cache size of your computer having an effect?
• Did you have any interesting experiences with the random number generator? Do you trust it?

You will also be submitting your code electronically to the libcs124 directory, so that we may test it
as necessary
